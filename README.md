# Breast Cancer Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

## 🌐 Overview
Breast cancer is a critical health issue, and predicting patient survival after surgery is paramount for effective treatment planning. This project focuses on breast cancer survival prediction using machine learning. The dataset comprises information on over 400 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery for treatment.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes various patient attributes such as age, gender, protein expression levels, tumor stage, histology, hormone receptor statuses, surgery types, and survival status.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Utilized Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly Express.
- Checked for null values and removed them.
- Explored insights like gender distribution, tumor stages, histology, hormone receptor statuses, and surgery types.

### Data Preprocessing
- Transformed categorical features into numerical values.
- Conducted additional data cleaning tasks.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized key aspects of the dataset using charts and graphs.
- Gained insights into the distribution of tumor stages, histology, hormone receptor statuses, and surgery types.

### Machine Learning Model Training
- Employed the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for binary classification.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained the SVM model using relevant features.

### Model Evaluation and Prediction
- Evaluated the model's performance on the test set.
- Demonstrated an example of predicting a patient's survival status based on input features.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

## 📈 Results
The trained model successfully predicts the survival status of breast cancer patients based on provided features. The project contributes to the application of machine learning in healthcare for informed decision-making in patient outcomes.
